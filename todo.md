<h1>To Do</h1>
<p>Make an independant repo</p>
<p>Make a better way to redirect to content owner.</p>
<p>Make a variable that checks window.top and location.href type stuff so there isnt 3 if statements.</p>
<p>Add sandbox iframe protection (may not work unless scripts are enabled in the top iframe).</p>
<p>More proxy/ripping protection</p>
<p>Make an option to add a function that the customer can put in their JS file, or make a custom html tag that only works when 25E is enabled.</p>
<p>Maybe an option to enable a captcha type thing that runs before anything else (it will check if certain scripts work/are successful).</p>
<p>maybe an actual captcha thing that checks for bots/security?</p>
